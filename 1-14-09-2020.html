<h1>welcome to blog</h1>
<a href="../blog">blog</a>
<p>for starters, I'm going to be pretty informal, but I'll try to have some conventions</p>
<p>like that "blog" link above</p>
<p>blog blog bloggety blog</p>
<p>I've decided I have a few interesting things to talk about, and I type a lot faster than I think, so I like the idea of keeping a blog of my best ideas and taking the time to revisit, refine, and improve the best ideas in a way people can follow</p>
<p>that might be one version of what a blog is for</p>
